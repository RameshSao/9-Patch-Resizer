# ![Tools](https://github.com/redwarp/9-Patch-Resizer/blob/develop/res/img/icon_32.png) Resizer for iOS and Android image assets

This is a fork of the original [9-Patch-Resizer](https://github.com/redwarp/9-Patch-Resizer), a resizer tool to automaticaly resize png files and 9 patches in several densities (previously hosted on https://code.google.com/p/9patch-resizer/)

## Download

To get the latest build (.jar or .dmg file), check the release page on the github project: https://github.com/soymonitus/9-Patch-Resizer/releases

The .dmg file is just a Mac app wrapper around the executable .jar file, use it if you don't feel comfortable with a java archive ^_^

## What is it exactly?

Let's face it : juggling with densities for Android and iOS is a bit of a pain, especially when dealing with 9 patch png.

And then comes this tool, that takes any PNG file, or 9.png file, and generates automatically mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi png files for Android and @1x, @2x, @3x png files for iOS, and even an ImageAssets folder.

As simple as drag and drop can get.

Current version : *2.0.0*
